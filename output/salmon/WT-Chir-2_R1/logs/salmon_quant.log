Observed 519186 total fragments (519186 in most recent round)

[2019-11-11 11:30:25.062] [jointLog] [info] Computed 842 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-11-11 11:30:25.062] [jointLog] [info] Counted 20589 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-11 11:30:25.063] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0105935% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-11-11 11:30:25.064] [jointLog] [warning] Only 20589 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
